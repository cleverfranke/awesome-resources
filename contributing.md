# Contribution Guidelines

The idea is that the maintenance of this list remains both a labour of love and a group effort. You don't have to get approval on PRs, but if you're wondering whether or not a resource is, in fact, awesome - a good approach would be to share in one of the development channels in Slack and see what the reaction is. Most likely, somebody will suggest adding the resource to the list.

Currently, the only requirement is that the list remains **alphabetical** - lets see how that scales.

If you feel a resource requires additional context, you can add a hyphen to the link:

```
- [Title](link) - this is why this is awesome!
```
